Strangely this species has not been encountered in the wild, and the scanned specimen had to be artificially hatched within an alien containment unit. \n\n1. Lifecycle:\nIn the absence of wild specimens little can be known for certain about the cuddlefish's lifecycle. It is possible that environmental conditions have changed, forcing the species to the edge of extinction, and leaving its eggs in permanent stasis. It is also possible the cuddlefish has been genetically altered, or even imported to 4546B from another world.\n\n2. Behavior:\nWe do know that the cuddlefish is a herbivore which displays highly social behavior in its interspecies interactions. As was observed in earth dolphins before their extinction, this creature seems to understand the concept of other minds, the prime indicator of true sentience, and attempts to communicate with a series of chirps and chirrups.\n\n3. Interaction:\nEvidence suggests the cuddlefish is capable of understanding and following simple commands, in addition to assessing the emotional state of individuals around it and responding in kind.\n\nAssessment: Emotional connection between living creatures is an essential component of psychological health",

Filtration System: \nThick, non-reactive skin and multiple gill layers render this creature impervious to the noxious acid clouds it produces.\n\n2. Algae Gland:\nA bulbous, sack-like appendage on the rear end. A luminescent yellow algae grows inside the sack and produces the poisonous compound. Abdominal muscles can contract, causing the algae gland to emit the noxious compound into the surrounding water.\n\n3. Large Pelvic Fins:\nCapable of powerful movement through the water when moving in small herds.\n\n4. Behavior:\nGasopods appear to be social in nature, and may even use their emissions in their relationship rituals. Their audible calls are likely signifiers of nearby threats, or food sources.\n\nAssessment: Approach with caution - Acidic pods may be retrieved and re-purposed",

Teeth:\nThe stalker's teeth are unusually hard, and fast-growing. Its elongated snout can deliver huge biting pressure to larger attackers, while also being used to reach small herbivores seeking refuge amongst the rocks.\n\n2. Night-vision:\nRetinal layering on the eyeball suggests adaptation for night-time hunting.\n\n3. Dorsal Ridges:\nThese ridges can be moved independently to deliver superior maneuverability.\n\n4.

Forward Dorsal Fin:\nThe unusual location of this fin suggests a purpose unrelated to movement through the water. It may be employed in shifting sand beneath the surface, or in mating rituals, or may simply be an evolutionary dead end.\n\n2. Segmented Exoskeleton:\nThick armor plating renders the sand shark almost immune to attack from above. While it is capable of impressive acceleration its exoskeleton prevents it from changing direction quickly. The sand shark is thus a perfectly-designed ambush hunter, but ill-suited to sustained pursuits.\n\n3. Feet:\nIll-designed for ambulation.

This suggests an evolutionary path quite different from other organisms on 4546B, most of which are vertebrate in nature. The reefback species has likely been able to grow far larger than other herbivores because anything large enough to break through its shell has long since gone extinct.\n\n2. Enzyme Pods:\nSimilar in appearance to the algae glands of the gasopod, these organs on the reefback's underside serve some unknown purpose in its digestive system, and are capable of expelling small quantities of stomach enzymes into the surrounding waters.\n\n3. Local Microcosm:\nAn array of different barnacle and plant species grow on the reefback's shell, thrusting their roots into ancient scars in the chitin, and taking advantage of their mobility to avoid predation. Nonetheless reefbacks will often be pursued by the faster, hungrier herbivores, and thus this leviathan species is a mobile microcosm worthy of years of study in itself.\n\n4. Lifecycle:\nReefbacks's lifespans likely extend through many centuries, should they survive their initial growth cycle. For the first few decades their smaller size would make them vulnerable to carnivorous leviathans.

I had Maida salvage the Degasi wreck, set Bart to finding us a stable source of food. His education is paying off sooner than I'd anticipated.\n\nOur only problem is Maida. She says the weather's going to turn. I say she's finding excuses to risk our lives. I imagine she's not gone a week in her life without a physical altercation, and she's itching for a fight. In every judgment she makes things go from bad to worse. \n\nIf she had my experience she'd have more faith. Humans have spent millennia specializing in how to shackle nature to our will.

So I started looking for a natural substrate that would strengthen the glass we have, and those stalker teeth we've been finding fit the bill - only, well, we needed more.\n\nThat's when Marguerit got interested. She actually listened to me - more than I can say for father - and I worked up the courage to talk about my more... tentative theories. When I told her they were attracted to metal deposits, that their teeth get dislodged when they pick them up, her eyes narrowed and she dashed out of the room.\n\nThree hours later she came back, her pack loaded down with stalker teeth! I asked her about it. She shrugged and said my theories were good. Said she had them eating out the palm of her hand. I think she meant it literally.\n\nShe is incredible. She went out to the kelp forests, armed with just a heatblade, and went fin to fin with a pack of stalkers.\n\nOn the one hand, that is the coolest thing I have ever heard. On the other, I hope the stalkers didn't come off worse than Marguerit did. She had a huge gash on her forearm. I don't think things went as smoothly as she made out. And what's the point in surviving here if we have to kill everything that makes it so wonderful?\n\nI wish I knew more about these animals, but father won't let me leave the habitat.

He'd tell me it was childish, but I stare out the window and sometimes I think how lucky I am to see this world up close. Back on the island I wouldn't have believed the creatures that live down here. The fish, they GLOW... There's one that's 90% eyeball... Snakes twice the length of a habitat compartment.\n\nCertainly it's not all friendly. Most of the plantlife is toxic, I learned that the hard way, but I've managed to coax some marblemelons into growing indoors, and when they don't cover our dietary needs, well... we eat the fish themselves. It's a bit gross, but it's nothing they wouldn't do.\n\nI've been attempting to document my findings. Father approves. He says understanding is power. That the more we know about this planet, the more we can use it to our advantage. I'm just doing it because it's fun. It's not easy without proper equipment and network access, but the old fashioned way - observing, taking notes, testing theories - shows me the world in a way a spectroscopic analysis never could.\n\nLately I've been watching the crabsnakes. They ambush their prey as it tries to feed on the mushrooms they hide in. What they don't eat settles on the seabed, which fertilizes the mushrooms, which feeds the herbivores, and so the chain continues. Co-evolution gives me the fuzzies.",

Plasteel to the Federation... this family operates nine different mining colonies across the Ariadne Arm. Maida thinks she's better suited to lead? Her contract still says otherwise.\n\nBut... I just cannot damn tell whether it's the stupidest idea I ever heard, or my only hope. I turned 80 years old last week. I thought I had another 80 in me, but marooned on this planet there's no swapping out of my liver when the old one fails. Here, I'm mortal. And Maida is useful.\n\nSo it's my responsibility to make a decision. Return to the island and hope whatever knocked the Degasi out of the sky won't do the same to the rescue ship, or take us deeper in search of answers. And all the while be hoping old age gets me before the seamonsters do.\n\nI'll give Maida just one thing. She was right about these caves. There's enough lithium there to fabricate a hundred tons of plasteel. Enough for a damn FLEET of Cyclops submarines. There was nothing anyone could have done to avoid crashing here, but I was right to order the detour.

What use is learning to draw or sing in a world where there's no human resource department to co-ordinate the galleries and concerts? On Alterra worlds, psychometric testing and specialized digi-training makes the most of everyone's talents.'\n\nMax Zoinkoff: 'I started out in marketing for Alterra Survival Systems. It was good work, but I thought I could do better. I set up my own company, developing bespoke code for the Seamoth so it could operate in open space, not just underwater.

    "EncyDesc_OuterBiomeWreckLore4": "How are the 'individuals' which make up a hive mind to be categorized? Are they merely dumb components of the larger, intelligent organism; or is the larger 'mind' merely a product of the independent organisms? Can it be both?\n\nWe define organisms by their traits, but find invariably that these traits depend on those of their environment. The concept of a tadpole is meaningless without the concept of the frog it will develop into. The idea of a predator is empty without an understanding of its prey. This begs the question: if we define everything by reference to everything else, what have we actually explained?\n\nAn illustrative experiment was recently performed on the hive mind colony discovered on Strader VI. A device was placed outside the nest which would electrocute individuals approaching it. An ant colony would have lost many individuals before a basic danger signal was successfully communicated between them, resulting in 'learned' avoidance of the device. Successful, but costly.\n\nThe Strader VI colony quickly formed into two factions:\n - One attempted to move the device by brute force, sacrificing individuals as they did so\n - The second attempted to cover the device in sand.\n \nThese two goals being mutually exclusive, a fight ensued. The first faction was beaten, in virtue of their reduced numbers. The device was safely buried, and the survivors called a truce. From the perspective of the individuals, this experience must have been horrific. From the perspective of the hive mind, a nagging problem had been overcome with the most effective solution. Which perspective is the 'correct' one?\n\nWe suggest that it is neither. By attempting to fit such entities into our rigid set of concepts we are painting onto the world a false impression of concreteness and meaning, which is a reflection of our concepts of ourselves.\n\nWe describe Strader VI individuals as 'attacking' one another, just as we describe microbes in the human body. Yet the Strader colony, like the body, cannot be healthy as a whole without the 'aggressions' of its components. We describe neurons in the brain as being dumb, but brains as a whole as intelligent - but when an idea takes hold in the brain, and forces out inferior ones, do we describe this as an act of aggression? Do we mourn dead neurons?\n\nWhen a philosophy, or a technology takes hold in human society... when wars are fought over them and people die... is that rightly seen as being good, or evil? This is not to undermine the meaning of our existence. From where we stand, our existence is very serious indeed. But is our civilization, and our universe, really any different from the colony on Strader VI? Is intelligence something limited to things of flesh and blood? Or is the universe truly one giant intelligent system, and we but amoeba blowing self-important potholes in its surface?\n\nWe would do well, as scientists, to remember that our goal is not to paint the world as we see it, but to see it as it truly is.",

This saved game does not include all that cool new terrain.\n\nIf you choose to keep playing this saved game, it will be upgraded.

    "TerrainSystemInformationText": "Subnautica uses a voxel terrain system that stores information in batches. Each batch is a 160m wide cube, and the world is made up of about 12,500 of them.\n\nThe development team is constantly working on these batches. New caves are carved, ravines cut out, Kelp Forests planted, and rock formations sculpted.\n\nSubnautica is updated frequently. If Experimental branch is played, it is updated three times per day! Saved games need to work across multiple game versions. Otherwise, as soon as the development team released an update, the saved game would be lost.\n\nMost saved game information can survive an update. For example, an inventory containing two oxygen tanks can survive if a new type of craftable diving suit is added to the game.\n\nOther information can't survive an update. For example, suppose a seabase is built on a cliff, and suppose the development team works on the batch containing that cliff, raising the cliff height.\n\nIf that save game is loaded, the seabase will be stuck inside the cliff. Not only will the base be inaccessible, but the player might be stuck in there too, and all hell will break loose inside Subnautica's game logic.\n\nTo solve this problem, every saved game retains its own copy of terrain data. This data stores the world as it was when that game was started, along with any modifications made by a player (For example, digging sand to create a cave).\n\nAs new updates are released, the saved game receives new features, items, creatures, and so on. But it never receives new terrain. This is often ok. In the case of major updates, it is not.\n\nNew game systems and items included in this update depend on the data contained in new terrain batches. If a an old saved game tries to play current version, it will not work properly and might even crash Subnautica completely.\n\nThis is why old saved games must be upgraded to play the game. Therefore some terrain batches are forced to update, allowing the new update to function. Any stuff (such as seabases) placed in these batches is destroyed by this process, to avoid the stuck-in-a-cliff scenario described above.\n\nHowever, the upgrade is not perfect. Depending on specific circumstances, it is possible that gaps could open up in terrain, or systems fail to function perfectly. In addition, the upgrade does not include all the new terrain data from the rest of the world.\n\n To play with an entirely up to date world, it is necessary to start a new game. The choice is yours. Regardless of your choice, thank you for participating in Subnautica Early Access. You are quite literally watching an alien ocean world grow before your eyes. This saved game upgrade process is a prime example of that growth.",

Subnautica needs four gigabytes (GB) of RAM to be able to think about all the creatures, terrain, physics, and gameplay found in the game world. Without 4 GB of RAM, Subnautica can't think properly, and will crash. \n\nIt is not possible to get more RAM using software tools. Freeing space on your disk drive by deleting files and folders will not make more RAM available. To get more RAM, it is necessary to install more or higher capacity RAM modules in your computer.\n\nDepending on what type of computer you have, this may or may not be possible. For example, it is often very hard to install more RAM in a laptop. You may be able to contact your computer manufacturer and ask them if it is possible to upgrade your computer.\n\nIf you would like to learn more about RAM, and how to get more of it, try opening a discussion on the support forums.

However, your frame-rate (the speed at which the game runs) may be very poor.

The number of thoughts that a CPU can think at once is determined by the number of logical processors it has.\n\nCPUs can have multiple logical processors by having more than one 'core' - a piece of hardware that executes threads. They can split those cores into multiple threads. For example, many Intel CPUs use a technique called 'Hyper Threading.'\n\nHowever the CPU goes about having more than one logical processor, Subnautica needs at least two of them to run properly.

Highly Developed Night-vision:\nLarge, complex eyeballs provide this herbivore superior vision in the dark, and an intense phobia of light.\n\n2. Lack of Beak:\nWhile the peeper uses its beak to break down tough corals, the oculus likely feeds on the soft fungal growths of the jellyshroom caves and thus has no need of one.\n\n3. Separated Tail Fin:\nThe caves in which the oculus lives make it hard to escape from fast predators. The oculus has adapted by splitting its tail fin into five separate tendrils.

Those individuals fortunate enough to attach to a digestible nutrient source will grow in size, thus increasing their buoyancy and drawing whatever they are attached to closer to the surface. \n\nIn extreme circumstances a number of floaters may attach to a leviathan class lifeform, forcing it to the surface and effectively asphyxiating it.

Olfactory Stalk:\nWhile the red-tipped protrusion on the blighter's head once served as sensory apparatus, it has adapted not to chase but to coax its prey into its path. As prey creatures are attracted to the dancing of the stalk, the blighter can dart forward to catch and consume them.\n\n2. Teeth:\nOne row of sharp, piercing teeth is all the blighter needs to tear through its prey.\n\n3. Eyes:\nThis creature has found little use for eyes in the deep, dark caverns it inhabits, and its eyeballs are likely sensitive to nothing more than broad fluctuations in local lightsources (eg when a meal is crossing its path).\n\nAssessment: Avoid or incapacitate",

Behavior:\nMoves in schools for protection, but will disperse and flee if necessary, whereon those fortunate enough to escape the gaze of their assailants will make for the sea floor and hide amongst the detritus.\n \nAssessment: Edible (low calorie count)",

Limbs:\nFive legs, two arms and a large flipper allow the rockgrub to cling to and walk across rock faces in search of food, and swiftly swim to safety when under attack.\n\n3. Green Luminescence:\nGlowing green in the dark would seem like a poor survival strategy, but this adaptation may be a mating behavior or other specialized process, engaged in by only a fraction of the total population at any one time. Or perhaps being eaten is simply part of the rockgrub's lifecycle.\n\nAssessment: Harmless",

Torso:\nThe blood crawler can lower its entire body to bring its mandibles within grasping distance of the carrion on which it feeds, while retaining the maneuverability it requires to avoid its predators.\n\nAssessment: Necessary waste recycler - Avoid or incapacitate",

It likely developed photosensitive skin on each side, which over time became eyeballs, and allowed it to detect the presence of nearby threats more efficiently than other prey fish. As the species grew in number it expanded to new territories, developing into subspecies like the eyeye and the reginald.\n\nModern day features of the peeper such as its twin expulsion tubes and powerful fins are quite recent adaptations, supporting the theory that life on 4546B underwent a period of rapid evolution in recent millenia in response to an external threat.\n\nAssessment: Extinct",

Eggs discovered in the wild are in some form of natural stasis, likely awaiting ideal conditions in which to hatch, or the delivery of some vital enzyme which will kick start the process.\n\nIt is impossible to calculate the species of the egg from the exterior, however it may be possible to stimulate a hatching response if an egg is relocated to a suitable alien containment unit.",
